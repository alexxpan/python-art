# python-art

Generative art made in the Nodebox Mac application, written in python. Uses external libraries provided by Nodebox such as Boids, Colors, and Cornu to visually model code. The 'bokeh' folder contains code and examples to generate random images resembling bokeh: the blur produced in the out-of-focus parts of an image produced by a lens. The 'fire' folder contains snapshots and code for an abstract fire animation.
